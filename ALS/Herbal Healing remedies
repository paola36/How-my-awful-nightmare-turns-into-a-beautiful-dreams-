My first symptoms of ALS occurred in 2021 but was diagnosed in 2022. I had severe symptoms ranging from shortness of breath, balance problems, couldn't walk without a walker, or a power chair. I had difficulty swallowing and fatigue. I was given medications which helped but only for a short burst of time, then I decided to try alternative measures and began on ALS Formula treatment from Dr.GODSENT YARE'S herbal healing home, It has made a tremendous difference for me. You can reach out to him by email: dryareherbalcurehome@gmail.comÂ  I had improved walking balance, increased appetite, muscle strength, improved eyesight, and others. To everyone Suffering from ALS/MND, some form of mental health or vicious cycle, you are not alone. Is ok to talk about it. The best thing for your mind is to talk. If you know someone suffering, simply be there for them. I promise to keep on keeping on sharing this awesome remedy by Dr.GODSENT YARE to everyone everywhere. Sharing is caring. 

Blessings!
